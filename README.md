#**Full 360° Scanner 2D Based on Sonar Sensor.**

Using a sonar sensor (ultrasound), an embedded system based on the Atmega32, and a full 360° rotation system the goal of this project is implementing a full 360° scanner 2D which sends data to the PC for plotting. In the PC, the maximum distance of interest must be configurable as well as the communication parameters with the microcontroller. The operation of the device must be continuous, it means that the sonar is always rotating, generating data, sending this data to the PC and plotting it.

##**Phase No. 1:**
- To research in the scientific bibliography about how to handle the sonar sensor, how to implement a full 360° rotating platform and sending data to the PC.
- The hardware schematics include the processing unit, the sonar sensor, rotating unit, and serial communication.
- The software design using R.U.P. (functional and non-functional requirements, conceptual diagram, real use cases, sequence diagrams and flow diagram).
- Digital report.

##**Phase No. 2:**
- The mechanical platform with the sonar sensor, the rotating unit mounted on it working.
- The sonar sensor works using the microcontroller.
- The rotating unit works using the microcontroller.
- The serial communication with the PC working with the microcontroller.
- Digital report with The RUP documentation updated

##**Phase No. 3:**
- The full 360° scanner 2D acquires data, and sends this information to the PC.
- The GUI in the PC shows the data received by the serial port.
- The GUI with the configuration options and how these options are applied to the full 360° scanner 2D.
- Final firmware development documentation using R.U.P. (functional and non-functional requirements, conceptual diagram, real use cases, sequence diagrams and flow diagram).
- Digital report
